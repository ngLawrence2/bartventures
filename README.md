# Welcome to BartVenture

## `Background and Overview`
   This is a Bart App targeted at tourists visiting the San Francisco Bay Area. A user can use the app to figure out where they can get to by Bart with a certain amount of money. In addition, users can look at the popular attractions near that Bart Station to better help them make up their mind where to explore.

## `Functionality and MVP`

### `Map`

We used Google Maps API to include the map on our website. Map shows users how far they can get with their budget on Bart.

### `Markers`

There are markers within the map that show public attractions, such as parks, museums, and tourist areas. Users can get more specific information of a certain public attraction and see an image of it by clicking the corresponding marker within the map.

### `User authentication`

Bart Ventures has a secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt. This is a step towards giving logged users opportunity to comment on certain attractions (which is a future feature).

## `Technologies and Technical Challenges`

* `MongoDB` for managing our database
* `Express` for simplifying the server creation process
* `Node.js` based server
* `Axios` for fetching information from the backend
* `JavaScript ES6` for enhancing components
* `React.js` for updating and rendering proper components
* `Redux` for maintaining predictable state
* `MLab` for remote storage
* `HTML5` for formatting
* `CSS3` for styling components
